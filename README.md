A react native wrapper of Yoti IDV for [Android](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-ios). Yoti IDV allows a user of your app to take a photo of their document, as well as to scan or capture their face, we then verify this instantly and prepare a response, which your system can then retrieve on your hosted site.

## Prerequisites
To integrate with Yoti IDV, a working infrastructure is needed (see [developers.yoti.com](https://developers.yoti.com/identity-verification/overview) for more details or get in touch with us [here](https://developers.yoti.com/support)).

## Requirements
- [Android SDK 3+](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android/releases)
- [iOS SDK 5+](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-ios/releases)

## Integration
Start your integration by adding the following dependency to your `package.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native": "^3.0.0"
}
```

### Android
Continuing with your integration for Android, add the following property and repository to your project's [`build.gradle`](https://developer.android.com/build#build-files) file:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        yotiSdkVersion = "3.4.0"
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.microblink.com'
        }
    }
}
```
Now add any of these optional dependencies to your app's [`build.gradle`](https://developer.android.com/build#build-files) file:
```groovy
dependencies {
    // With automatic capture via OCR and NFC capture
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-doc-scan:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    // With manual capture only, no OCR, no NFC - around 14Mb smaller in size
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-doc-scan-slim:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-doc-scan-sup:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-liveness-zoom:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    // With embedded AI model
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-facecapture:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
     // Without embedded AI model - around 20 MB smaller in size
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-facecapture-unbundled:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
}
```
If you're using Proguard or another obfuscation tool, you should also add the following configuration rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:
```groovy
-keep class com.yoti.** { *; }
-keep class com.microblink.** { *; }
-keep class com.microblink.**$* { *; }
-dontwarn com.microblink.**
-keep class com.facetec.zoom.** { *; }
-dontwarn javax.annotation.Nullable
```

### iOS
To continue your integration with iOS, you should add the following to your [`Podfile`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html) and run `pod install` from its directory:
```bash
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'

platform :ios, '11.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  config = use_native_modules!
  use_react_native!(:path => config[:reactNativePath])
  use_frameworks!
  use_native_modules!
  pod 'YotiDocumentScan'                // Include if `YotiSDKIdentityDocument` is included and to support identity document OCR
  pod 'YotiNFC'                         // Include if `YotiSDKIdentityDocument` is included and to support identity document NFC
  pod 'YotiSDKIdentityDocument'         // Optional
  pod 'YotiSDKSupplementaryDocument'    // Optional
  pod 'YotiSDKFaceTec'                  // Optional
  pod 'YotiSDKFaceCapture'              // Optional
end
```
In addition, you should add [`NSCameraUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) to your `Info.plist`.

And if you have included `YotiNFC` in your target, make sure to also:
- Add [`NFCReaderUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nfcreaderusagedescription) to your `Info.plist`
- Add [`com.apple.developer.nfc.readersession.iso7816.select-identifiers`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/select-identifiers) to your `Info.plist` and include [`A0000002471001`](https://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p10_cons_en.pdf) as an application identifier for your app to support
- Turn on [`Near Field Communication Tag Reading`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/building_an_nfc_tag-reader_app) under the Signing & Capabilities tab for your projectâ€™s target

## Usage
### 1. Import module
```javascript
import RNYotiDocScan from '@getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native';
```
### 2. Launch a session
Launch a session with its required parameters using the `startSession` function.
```javascript
const successCallback = (code, description) => {
    ...
}
const errorCallback = (code, description) => {
    ...
}
RNYotiDocScan.startSession(id, token, successCallback, errorCallback);
```

### 3. Customizations
On iOS, you can set the primary color using the following API:
```javascript
RNYotiDocScan.setPrimaryColorRGB(0, 0, 0); // default: (40, 117, 188)
```
To customize the colors on Android, please refer to its separate [documentation](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android#colours).

In addition, you can choose to also specify a request code on Android:
```javascript
RNYotiDocScan.setRequestCode(0); // default: 9001
```
