# Yoti Doc Scan SDK for React Native

[![GitHub tag (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native?label=latest%20release)](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native/releases) [![Publish Release](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native/workflows/Publish%20Release/badge.svg)](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Publish+Release%22)

Yoti is an identity checking platform that allows organisations to verify who people are, online and in person. The Yoti Doc Scan SDK allows the user to take a photo of their identifying document which we verify instantly and prepare a response which your system can then retrieve. Further information can be found in the [documentation](https://developers.yoti.com/yoti/getting-started-docscan).

## Prerequisites

A supporting Yoti Doc Scan SDK backend installation is required. Learn more about the backend SDK in the [Getting Started guide](https://developers.yoti.com/yoti/getting-started-docscan).

## React Native >= 0.60.0 installation

`yarn add @getyoti/react-native-yoti-doc-scan`

Navigate to your iOS folder and update pods with:

`pod install`

React Native autolinking will handle the rest of the native configuration. Should autolinking fail, consult the [troubleshooting instructions](#troubleshooting).

**Note**: Make sure to add [`use_frameworks!`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podfile.html#use_frameworks_bang) to your [`Podfile`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html).

## React Native 0.59.x installation

Install the library with:

`yarn add @getyoti/react-native-yoti-doc-scan`

Link the library:

`react-native link @getyoti/react-native-yoti-doc-scan`

If you're using CocoaPods, navigate to your `ios` and update your `Podfile`:

```diff
  pod 'Folly', :podspec => '../node_modules/react-native/third-party-podspecs/Folly.podspec'
+ `pod 'react-native-yoti-doc-scan', :path => '../node_modules/@getyoti/react-native-yoti-doc-scan/react-native-yoti-doc-scan.podspec'`
end
```

And then your pods with:

`pod install`

If autolinking fails, refer to the [troubleshooting instructions](#troubleshooting).

## Android configuration

### Microblink

Add microblink to your repositories in the root build.gradle file (`android/build.gradle`):

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url 'https://maven.microblink.com' }
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```
### Debug build configuration

Add this configuration for the debug build type to your `buildTypes` block (`android/app/build.gradle`):

```groovy
buildTypes {
    debug {
        matchingFallbacks = ['release']
      ...
    }
    ...
}

```
If you're using [Firebase Performance Monitoring](https://rnfirebase.io/perf/usage) you'll need to disable it for debug built variant. One way to do this is including this flag in your `gradle.properties` file:

```groovy
firebasePerformanceInstrumentationEnabled=false

```
And update your release build command line to enable it:

```groovy
./gradlew assembleRelease -PfirebasePerformanceInstrumentationEnabled=true

```

### Release build configuration
If you're using **Proguard** or other obfuscation tool, add the following configuration rules to your proguard-rules.pro file:
```groovy
-keep class com.yoti.** { *; }
-keep class com.microblink.** { *; }
-keep class com.microblink.**$* { *; }
-dontwarn com.microblink.**
-keep class com.facetec.zoom.** { *; }
-dontwarn javax.annotation.Nullable
```


Depending on your Android project setup and version of React Native, you
may encounter the following error during your build process:

> More than one files produce libc++_shared.so

Resolve by adding the following packaging options to your `android` block (`android/app/build.gradle`):

```groovy
android {
    compileSdkVersion rootProject.ext.compileSdkVersion
    
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'lib/x86/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libjsc.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libjsc.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libc++_shared.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libc++_shared.so'
    }
    ...

```

> Running out of memory `space: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space`

Resolve by increasing the daemon memory settings in your `gradle.properties` file:

```groovy
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4608m
```

# Usage

The SDK exposes a single method, `startSession()`, which handles communication between your app and the Yoti app on a user's device.

Import the SDK with:
```javascript
import YotiDocScan from '@getyoti/react-native-yoti-doc-scan';
```

Call the `startSession` method with your session ID and client session token. 
The method accepts two callbacks: one invoked on success, and the other when the result is a failure.
```javascript
function onSuccess (code, description) {
    // handle success scenario
}
function onError (code, description) {
    // handle error scenario
}
YotiDocScan.startSession(
    sessionId,
    clientSessionToken,
    onSuccess,
    onError
);
```

In addition, you can choose to also specify an Android request code, or set the primary color of the iOS SDK using an RGB value. E.g.:
```javascript
YotiDocScan.setRequestCode(8888); // default: 9001
YotiDocScan.setPrimaryColorRGB(0, 0, 0); // default: (34, 157, 255)
```

To customize the colors of the Android SDK, please refer to its documentation [here](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android#colours).

Your callbacks will receive a consistent response with two parameters: `code` (number) and `description` (string).
The `code` is always populated with one of the values in the results table below.
The `description` is not guaranteed to always have a value and as such your business logic should not rely on it.


| Code              | Message                      | Retry possible for the same session                    |

## Troubleshooting

<details>
	<summary>Resolving autolinking failures on Android and iOS</summary>


### iOS

Linker errors pertaining to Swift libraries such as `swiftFoundation` can be resolved with one or more of the solutions mentioned [in this oft-quoted StackOverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52536380/why-linker-link-static-libraries-with-errors-ios), depending on your React Native version and project setup.

### Android

Android linking is performed in 3 steps:

#### android/settings.gradle

Add the following to your settings.gradle file as a new entry before the last line which has `include ':app'`:

```groovy
    include ':react-native-yoti-doc-scan'
    project(':react-native-yoti-doc-scan').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-yoti-doc-scan/src/android')

    include ':app'
```

#### android/app/build.gradle

Find the `dependencies` block in your build.gradle file and add `implementation project(':react-native-yoti-doc-scan')`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation project(':react-native-yoti-doc-scan')
}
```


#### android/app/src/main/java/..../MainApplication.java

Add this import for the package:

```diff
import android.app.Application;
import com.facebook.react.ReactApplication;
+ import com.yoti.reactnative.RNYotiDocScanPackage;
```

Find the `getPackages` function and add `new RNYotiDocScanPackage()` to the list of packages.

```diff
@Override
protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
        new MainReactPackage(),
+       new RNYotiDocScanPackage(),
        ...
```
