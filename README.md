A react native wrapper of Yoti IDV for [Android](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-ios). Yoti IDV allows a user of your app to take a photo of their document, as well as to scan or capture their face, we then verify this instantly and prepare a response, which your system can then retrieve on your hosted site.

## Prerequisites
To integrate with Yoti IDV, a working infrastructure is needed (see [developers.yoti.com](https://developers.yoti.com/identity-verification/overview) for more details or get in touch with us [here](https://developers.yoti.com/support)).

## Requirements
- [Android SDK 4+](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android/releases)
- [iOS SDK 7+](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-ios/releases)

## Integration
Start your integration by adding the following dependency to your `package.json` file:
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native": "^5.0.0"
}
```

### Android
Continuing with your integration for Android, add the following property and repository to your project's [`build.gradle`](https://developer.android.com/build#build-files) file:
```groovy
buildscript {
    ext {
        yotiSdkVersion = "4.0.0"
    }
}
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven {
            url 'https://maven.regulaforensics.com/RegulaDocumentReader'
        }
    }
}
```
Now add any of these optional dependencies to your app's [`build.gradle`](https://developer.android.com/build#build-files) file:
```groovy
dependencies {
    // With automatic capture via OCR and NFC capture
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-doc-scan:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    // With manual capture only, no OCR, no NFC - around 14Mb smaller in size
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-doc-scan-slim:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-doc-scan-sup:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-liveness-zoom:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
    // With embedded AI model
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-facecapture:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
     // Without embedded AI model - around 20 MB smaller in size
    implementation "com.yoti.mobile.android.sdk:yoti-sdk-facecapture-unbundled:${rootProject.ext.yotiSdkVersion}"
}
```
If you're using Proguard or another obfuscation tool, you should also add the following configuration rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file:
```groovy
-keepclassmembers class kotlinx.** {
    volatile <fields>;
}
-keep class com.yoti.** { *; }
-dontwarn com.facetec.sdk.**
-keep class com.facetec.sdk.** { *; }
-dontwarn javax.annotation.Nullable
-keepclassmembers class io.ktor.** { volatile <fields>; }
```

### iOS
To continue your integration with iOS, you should add the following to your [`Podfile`](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/the-podfile.html) and run `pod install` from its directory:
```bash
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'

platform :ios, '13.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  config = use_native_modules!
  use_react_native!(:path => config[:reactNativePath])
  use_frameworks!
  use_native_modules!
  pod 'YotiDocumentScan'                // Include if `YotiSDKIdentityDocument` is included and to support identity document OCR
  pod 'YotiNFC'                         // Include if `YotiSDKIdentityDocument` is included and to support identity document NFC
  pod 'YotiSDKIdentityDocument'         // Optional
  pod 'YotiSDKSupplementaryDocument'    // Optional
  pod 'YotiSDKFaceTec'                  // Optional
  pod 'YotiSDKFaceCapture'              // Optional
end
```
In addition, you should [modify the properties and capabilities of your project's target](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-ios?tab=readme-ov-file#5-modify-the-properties-and-capabilities-of-your-projects-target).

## Usage
### 1. Import module
```javascript
import RNYotiDocScan from '@getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-react-native';
```
### 2. Optional configuration and customization
For customization on Android, you can refer to the documentation outlined [here](https://github.com/getyoti/yoti-doc-scan-android?tab=readme-ov-file#customisation). In addition, you can choose to also set a request code:
```javascript
RNYotiDocScan.setRequestCode(0); // default: 9001
```

On iOS, the SDK expects launched sessions to contain multiple flows by default. To enable single-flow sessions, configure and include [yoti-doc-scan-react-native-configuration-ios.json](templates/yoti-doc-scan-react-native-configuration-ios.json) in your projectâ€™s target and then set the configuration as follows:
```javascript
RNYotiDocScan.setConfiguration({
    bundle_identifier: "", // Optional: defaults to the main bundle identifier if not specified.
    filename: "yoti-doc-scan-react-native-configuration-ios.json"
});
```
Ensure that only one module type property is set to `true` when `single_flow` is enabled.

To customize the appearance on iOS, you can configure the SDK using [yoti-doc-scan-react-native-configuration-with-theme-ios.json](templates/yoti-doc-scan-react-native-configuration-with-theme-ios.json) instead, which supports the following options for theming:

- Light and dark mode color themes. We also support specifying only a primary color for each mode
- Typography theme (system and custom fonts, font weight, size, line height multiple and kern)
- Spacing mode (compact, regular and relaxed)
- Shape theme (corner radius and border width)
- Icon theme (custom vectors, system and custom SF Symbols, incl. localized ones)
- Illustration theme (custom vectors)

All customisation types are optional, and can be set independently from each other.

### 3. Launch a session
Launch a session with its required parameters using the `start` function.
```javascript
const completion = (code, description) => {
    ...
}
RNYotiDocScan.start(id, token, completion);
```

## Supported languages
Our SDK supports the 9 languages listed in the table below, but their use is driven by the localization configuration of your target. If your target only supports a subset of our SDK's supported languages, our SDK will fall back to English on the ones your target doesn't support.
